This is a Manchester Encoding Radio Frequency library created for Arduino. It contains three methods used for determining what is
meaningful data, how to read in the kind of data, storing the data. This library was created for 
RFID transponders using the EM4100 protocol, which contain the microchip made by the company EM Microelectronic.

It has been developed for the following open source github project for Biological Tracking:
